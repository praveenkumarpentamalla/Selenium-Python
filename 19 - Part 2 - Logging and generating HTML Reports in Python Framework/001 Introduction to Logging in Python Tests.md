## **1. Introduction to Logging**  
**Definition:**  
Logging is the process of recording events, actions, and messages generated during the execution of a program. These logs help developers and testers understand the flow of execution, debug issues, and analyze test results.  

**Example:**  
When running an automated test script, logging helps track:  
- When a user logs in  
- When data is entered into a form  
- When an assertion passes or fails  

**Why Use Logging Instead of Just Printing?**  
- **Print statements** only show output in the console and are temporary.  
- **Logging** saves records in a file, includes timestamps, and categorizes messages (e.g., errors, warnings).

## **2. Why is Logging Important?**  
Logging is crucial in framework development because:  

✅ **Debugging:** Helps identify where a test failed.  
✅ **Audit Trail:** Maintains a record of all test executions.  
✅ **Non-Technical Understanding:** Even non-developers (e.g., managers, manual testers) can read logs to understand failures.  
✅ **Performance Analysis:** Helps track slow operations.  

**Example Scenario:**  
If a payment test fails, logs should show:  
```
[2023-10-05 14:30:45] ERROR: Payment failed - Insufficient balance.  
[2023-10-05 14:30:46] INFO: Test terminated.  
```
Instead of just a generic error message.

## **3. Types of Logs**  
| Log Type | Description | Example Use Case |
|----------|------------|------------------|
| **Debug** | Detailed technical logs for developers | `DEBUG: Fetching user data from DB` |
| **Info** | General execution flow messages | `INFO: User logged in successfully` |
| **Warning** | Potential issues that don’t stop execution | `WARNING: Slow network detected` |
| **Error** | Failures that affect functionality | `ERROR: Login failed - Invalid credentials` |
| **Critical** | Severe issues that halt execution | `CRITICAL: Database connection lost` |

## **4. Logging Levels**  
Logging levels determine the severity of a message.  

**Hierarchy of Log Levels (Low to High Severity):**  
1. **DEBUG** – Diagnostic details (for developers).  
2. **INFO** – Confirmation of normal execution.  
3. **WARNING** – Indicates a potential problem.  
4. **ERROR** – A serious issue that failed a step.  
5. **CRITICAL** – A fatal error stopping execution.  

**Example in Python:**  
```python
import logging  

logging.debug("This is a debug message")  
logging.info("This is an info message")  
logging.warning("This is a warning")  
logging.error("This is an error")  
logging.critical("This is critical!")  
```

**Output:**  
```
WARNING: This is a warning  
ERROR: This is an error  
CRITICAL: This is critical!  
```
*(Note: By default, only `WARNING` and above are displayed.)*

## **5. Best Practices for Logging**  
✔ **Use Descriptive Messages**  
❌ Bad: `Error occurred`  
✅ Good: `ERROR: Payment failed - Card declined (Step 4)`  

✔ **Include Timestamps**  
- Helps track when an issue occurred.  

✔ **Log to Both Console and File**  
- Helps real-time debugging and historical analysis.  

✔ **Use Appropriate Log Levels**  
- Don’t log everything as `ERROR`; use `INFO` for normal flow.  

✔ **Avoid Sensitive Data in Logs**  
- Never log passwords or credit card numbers.

## **6. Implementing Logging in Python**  
### **Basic Logging Setup**  
```python
import logging  

# Configure logging  
logging.basicConfig(  
    filename='test.log',  
    level=logging.INFO,  
    format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'  
)  

# Example logs  
logging.info("Test started")  
logging.warning("Slow response from server")  
logging.error("Element not found")  
```

**Output in `test.log`:**  
```
2023-10-05 14:30:45 - INFO - Test started  
2023-10-05 14:30:46 - WARNING - Slow response from server  
2023-10-05 14:30:47 - ERROR - Element not found  
```

### **Advanced: Logging Handlers**  
```python
import logging  

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)  
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)  

# File handler  
file_handler = logging.FileHandler('framework.log')  
file_handler.setLevel(logging.ERROR)  

# Console handler  
console_handler = logging.StreamHandler()  
console_handler.setLevel(logging.INFO)  

# Format  
formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')  
file_handler.setFormatter(formatter)  
console_handler.setFormatter(formatter)  

logger.addHandler(file_handler)  
logger.addHandler(console_handler)  

logger.error("This goes to both file and console")  
```

---

## **7. Example: Logging in a Test Framework**  
**Scenario:** Login Test with Logging  
```python
def test_login():  
    logging.info("Starting login test")  
    try:  
        enter_username("testuser")  
        enter_password("pass123")  
        click_login()  
        logging.info("Login successful")  
    except Exception as e:  
        logging.error(f"Login failed: {str(e)}")  
```

**Log Output:**  
```
2023-10-05 14:35:00 - INFO - Starting login test  
2023-10-05 14:35:01 - ERROR - Login failed: Invalid credentials  
```

---

## **8. Conclusion**  
- Logging is **essential** for debugging and maintaining test frameworks.  
- Use **different log levels** (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `ERROR`) appropriately.  
- Log **clear, structured messages** with timestamps.  
- Store logs in **files** for future analysis.  

By implementing proper logging, you make your framework **more maintainable, debuggable, and user-friendly** for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
