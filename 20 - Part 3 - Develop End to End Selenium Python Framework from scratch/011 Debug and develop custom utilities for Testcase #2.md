## **1. Introduction to Reusable Utilities**

In test automation, utilities are reusable methods that encapsulate common actions, reducing code duplication and improving maintainability. This lecture demonstrates how to create a utility for selecting dropdown options by visible text and how to debug tests effectively.

---

## **2. Creating a Utility for Dropdown Selection**

### **Problem**
In the previous implementation, selecting a dropdown option required multiple lines of code:
```python
dropdown = Select(self.driver.find_element(By.ID, "exampleDropdown"))
dropdown.select_by_visible_text("Option Text")
```

### **Solution**
Create a reusable utility method in the base class to handle dropdown selection.

#### **Step 1: Define the Utility Method**
Add the following method to `BaseClass`:

```python
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import Select

class BaseClass:
    def select_option_by_text(self, locator, text):
        """
        Select a dropdown option by visible text.
        :param locator: The locator of the dropdown element.
        :param text: The visible text of the option to select.
        """
        dropdown = Select(self.driver.find_element(*locator))
        dropdown.select_by_visible_text(text)
```

#### **Explanation**
- The method `select_option_by_text` takes two parameters: `locator` (e.g., `(By.ID, "dropdown")`) and `text` (the visible option text).
- It creates a `Select` object and selects the option using `select_by_visible_text`.

## **3. Implementing the Utility in Tests**

### **Before Using Utility**
```python
def test_example(self):
    dropdown = Select(self.driver.find_element(By.ID, "dropdown"))
    dropdown.select_by_visible_text("India")
```

### **After Using Utility**
```python
def test_example(self):
    self.select_option_by_text((By.ID, "dropdown"), "India")
```

### **Benefits**
- Reduces code duplication.
- Improves readability and maintainability.
- The utility can be reused across multiple tests.

## **4. Debugging Tests in PyCharm**

### **Step 1: Set Breakpoints**
Click on the left gutter in PyCharm to set a breakpoint in your test or utility method.

### **Step 2: Run in Debug Mode**
- Right-click the test method or class.
- Select **Debug** instead of **Run**.
- The test execution will pause at the breakpoint.

### **Step 3: Inspect Variables**
- Use the **Debug** window to inspect variable values (e.g., `locator`, `text`).
- Use **Step Over** (F8) to execute the next line.
- Use **Resume** (F9) to continue execution.

### **Example Debugging Scenario**
1. Set a breakpoint in `select_option_by_text`.
2. Debug the test to verify if the correct `locator` and `text` are passed.
3. Confirm the dropdown selection works as expected.

## **5. Best Practices for Utilities**

1. **Generalize Methods**: Design utilities to handle common scenarios (e.g., dropdown selection, explicit waits).
2. **Use Descriptive Names**: Name methods clearly (e.g., `select_option_by_text`).
3. **Parameterize Inputs**: Allow flexibility by passing inputs (e.g., `locator`, `text`).
4. **Centralize Utilities**: Place all utilities in the base class or a dedicated utilities module.
5. **Document Utilities**: Add docstrings to explain the purpose and parameters of each utility.

---

## **6. Summary**

- **Reusable Utilities**: Encapsulate common actions like dropdown selection to reduce code duplication.
- **Implementation**: Define utilities in the base class and call them using `self.utility_name()`.
- **Debugging**: Use PyCharmâ€™s debug mode to set breakpoints and inspect variables.
- **Benefits**: Utilities improve code maintainability, readability, and reusability.

---

## **Next Steps**
- Replace hardcoded values in tests with data from external sources (e.g., JSON, CSV).
- Explore more utilities (e.g., handling alerts, scrolling, taking screenshots).
- Implement parameterized tests to run with multiple data sets.
